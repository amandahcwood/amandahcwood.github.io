    name: Ladyfriend IPA
    description: At only 50 IBUâ€™s our Ladyfriend IPA is a perfect balance between the light and the dark! A distinct malt profile provides a strong backbone giving way to subtle notes of balanced wild mountain honey and caramel. The aroma is one of passion fruit, citrus, and spring-valley heather!
